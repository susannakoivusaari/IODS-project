Assignment 1: Tasks and instructions

I came across this course through the university's email. As I work mostly with large open source datasets and Rstudio, I thought it would be very useful for me. I have almost none experience with GitHub, so especially that part of the course will be new to me.

I just finished chapters 1-5. I was surprised how well I already knew most of these themes -- only the functions in the lubridate package were more unfamiliar to me. However, I also learned some new tricks, e.g. that you can rename variables within select() function!
