# Chapter 1: Start me up!

I came across this course through the university's email. As I work a lot with large open source data sets and Rstudio, I thought it would be very useful for me. I have almost no experience with GitHub, so especially the part of the course that focuses on using GitHub is new to me.

I have now finished the first chapter of the course. I was surprised how well I already knew most of these themes -- only the functions in the lubridate package were more unfamiliar to me. However, I also learned some new tricks, e.g. that you can rename variables within select() function! This was very useful.

I think the Exercise set 1 is a great start for someone who is new to Rstudio. It has all the important functions to get started with processing your own data. The R Markdown syntax was at first a bit difficult to read in R, as I have never seen one before. However, I have read plenty of codes online written in this syntax, so its great to now learn how to make one in your own!
